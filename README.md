# happyrobot-fde-technical-challenge
Inbound carrier automation agent built for the HappyRobot FDE Technical Challenge. It handles inbound calls from carriers, verifies FMCSA, searches loads, negotiates rates, classifies the call, extracts structured data, and exposes a backend API to support the workflow. Includes Docker deployment, example payloads, and a custom metrics dashboard.
